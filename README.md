These project questions are taken from https://www.spreadsheetclass.com/google-sheets-skills-test/.

1. Rename the tab with the raw data, to "Data"

2. Freeze the header row of the "Data" tab, and make the headers big, bold, and centered so that they are easy for staff to read (Always do this in the future for additional tabs with headers)

3. Calculate the total points earned for all students (Display the total at the top of the "Points" column, and make sure the total is frozen just like the headers)

4. Calculate the average percentage score earned for all students (Display the average at the top of the "Score" column, and make sure the average is frozen just like the headers)

5. Put a thick border between columns F and G, to use as a divider between the left and right side of the sheet. We will use the blank section on the right of the border / divider, as an area to put more calculations.

6. Calculate how many students have a passing score in the class. A passing score / passing grade is any score that is 60% or higher. Also, in the cell above the calculation, put a text label that says "Students with passing grade" so we know what the number represents. The calculation and the label should both be frozen at the top of the sheet.

7. Calculate how many students received a failing score on their test. A failing grade is any score that is less than 60%. Also, in the cell above the calculation, put a text label that says "Students with failing grade" so we know what the number represents

8. Calculate the total number of students in the class / on the report (Display the number at the top of the sheet, and make sure that the number & the text label are frozen). The text label should be "# of Students"

9. Calculate the percentage of students who received a passing score. (With the label "% Students with passing grade" frozen at the top along with the calculation)

10. Calculate the percentage of students who received a failing score. (With the label "% Students with failing grade" frozen at the top along with the calculation)

11. In the "Score" column, make it so that the cell background color turns green (automatically) when a score is 60% or above.

12. In the "Score" column, make it so that the cell background color turns red (automatically) when a score is less than 60%.

13. Create a new tab, and name it "Passing Grades". The new tab will filter the data to show only data / rows with a passing score (This will be done automatically, by using a formula that connects / refers to the "Data" tab. Make sure that you include the appropriate headers at the top of the new tab (same as the headers from the "Data tab").

14. Modify the formula on the "Passing Grades" tab so that in addition to retaining the current functionality of showing only students with a passing score, the formula will also sort the data by student name. "Last Name" is the primary column to sort by, and then the "First Name" is the secondary column to sort by. So this one formula will show only data / students with a passing score, where the data is sorted by student name.

15. Create two new tabs. The first new tab will be named "Between 60 and 90". This first tab will show only rows where the scores are between 60% and 90% (By using a formula that connects / refers to the "Data" tab). Make sure that you include the appropriate headers at the top of the new tab (same as the headers from the "Data tab"). Also include scores in that are exactly equal to 60% or 90%.

16. The second new tab will be named "Below 60 or above 90". This second tab will show only rows where the scores are either below 60%, or above 90% (By using a formula that connects / refers to the "Data" tab). Make sure that you include the appropriate headers at the top of the new tab (same as the headers from the "Data tab").

17. Generate a list of each different teacher name, automatically with a formula (remove the duplicates). Make sure that the formula also sorts this list. Put the text label / header "Teachers" above the list of teachers.

18. To the right of each teacher name, display how many students that each teacher has on their roster / on the report (Automatically with formulas). Put the text label / header "Students per teacher" above these calculations."# google_sheets_project"
